Simple Conway Life game.

Standard tools - only one feature. “Bud” system.
When your game goes into stagnation, you can choose to bud from the cell which stays in one plays for a certain amount of moves.

“Bud” - randomly chosen cell from around the carrier which condition is inverted. So if it was 0 it goes 1 and another way.
Cell even can commit suicide to let the system evolve.

So it goes a lot of funnier!
Enjoy! =)
